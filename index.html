        <p>I think CSS is going to be fun.</p>
        <p>I just may be understanding this afterall! </p>

            then again, maybe not.
            <section style=" background-color:coral;">
                <h1 style="font-size:58px;">This is the largest heading size</h1 style>
            </section>
        <p>This is the second paragraph and according to our assignment should not have background color?</p>
        <p>If the first instruction was to create a heading with background color, should I remove the background color</p>
        <p>or should the background color stay?</p>

        <section style="background-color:darkgrey;">
            <h3 style="font-size:12px;">and this is a medium side header.....this is funny</h3 style>
        </section>
        <p>Intresting as I was able to have the paragraph not have bacground color </p>
        <p>OK, I think this is it!</p>
        <p>I know this is kinda silly, but I'm tiredand not very creative right now.</p>
